    <h2>My Sister, Always 🤍</h2>

    <p class="message">
     I’ve been thinking about you a lot lately, and I just felt like I needed to say this. You’ve been my sister from the very beginning, from when we were kids growing up together, sharing life before we even understood what life really was. 
     Even though you relocated to the US, that bond never changed for me—not for a second.
    </p>

     I’m honestly so proud of you. Watching you grow into the woman you are today has been amazing. You’re hardworking, focused, and determined, and seeing you pursue your degree in Nursing makes my heart full. I know how much effort, 
     sacrifice, and strength it takes, and you’re doing it with so much grace. You inspire me more than you know.
    </p>

    <p class="message">
Thank you for always being there for me. Through everything—my highs, my lows, my confusion—you’ve shown up. Your support, your advice, your care… I don’t take any of it for granted. 
I appreciate you deeply, and I’m grateful to have someone like you in my life.
    </p>

    <p class="message">
No matter the distance or time, you will always be my sister. I’m rooting for you every step of the way, and I can’t wait to see all the amazing things life still has in store for you. I love you, and I’m so proud of you. 🤍
    </p>
